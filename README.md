# 42-Hackathon-BuildTheBay

**"Build the Bay"** was a week-long hackathon that was hosted here at [42 Silicon Valley](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609045757/https://www.42.us.org/). It was designed to help make a difference in the Bay Area community. The focus was to use tech to help a local cause. This includes helping local nonprofits, charities, or family-owned local businesses. Anne Stedler, Economic Development Manager for the city of Newark, and Felix Lawrence, a local restaurant marketing partner, attended the event; details [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624222232/https://www.42.us.org/42-hosts-first-build-the-bay-hackathon/).

I was part of a 5 man team "**October's Very Own**", composed of [Kai Chen](https://github.com/yakuseishou),  [Christopher Ford](https://github.com/Chris7Ford), [Joseph Kaplin](https://github.com/jkaplin), [Kevin Colour](https://github.com/MrColour), and [myself](https://github.com/akharrou).

We built a Restaurant E-Guide that focuses on the needs of local restaurants. Specifically, we wanted to emphasize the positive experiences that people have had at restaurants in the Newark area.

The website was built with the **M.E.R.N** stack.
